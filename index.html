Hello! I'm Aditya Gupta, a passionate individual with a keen interest in science and technology. Currently pursuing my studies in Mathematics and computing at IIT (BHU) Varanasi , I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of mathematics, computing, and their applications in solving real-world problems.

Since childhood, I've been captivated by the wonders of science and the endless possibilities that technology brings to our lives. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of the universe through mathematical models or developing innovative software solutions to address societal challenges, I am always eager to explore and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of science and technology.

My journey in academia has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematics and computing, enabling me to tackle complex problems with analytical rigor and creative thinking. From coding elegant algorithms to delving into the depths of theoretical concepts, I find immense satisfaction in the process of learning and discovery.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively engage in projects and extracurricular activities that allow me to apply my knowledge and skills in practical settings. Whether it's participating in hackathons, conducting research, or collaborating on interdisciplinary initiatives, I thrive in environments that foster innovation and collaboration.

Through this portfolio website, I aim to showcase my projects, experiences, and insights gained along my journey. I invite you to explore my work and join me in the exploration of the exciting realms of science and technology.
